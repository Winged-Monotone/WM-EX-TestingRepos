For Psychopleth, will need to create a new process that somehow takes your starting deteriations and filters from the mutations of the old

maybe I can create a list of the current mutation defects
remove the defects on the next creature
and then move the current mutation defects to it after removing them.

might be more complicated methods.

--------------------

- Geletinous form should no longer be capable of taking damage from poison effects nor should it hold the poison status effect if somehow applied. 
- Gelatinous form is no longer capable of mutating burrowing claws to avoid overwritten pseudopods from being removed to give access to the claws. (Working on a more viable fix to have them both work with each other.
- Psychopleth now removes the mental mutations of the players from the husk that is given to the creature shunted.
- Psychopleth now properly adds Ancestral Scio and the Esper Genotype
- Edited the Poison Ichor to have proper evaporation points/etc.  
- fixed bug with Psybrachiomancy where the calculation of arms wasn't reflecting how many you should be able to summon.
- Soem typo fixes.
